1. Complete Components List

Arduino Uno / Nano	
Flex Sensors (2.2" or 4.5")	5	One for each finger
10kΩ Resistors	5	For voltage dividers
Servo Motors (SG90 or MG996R)	5	One per finger joint
Jumper Wires (Male–Male)	~30	For connections
Breadboard	1	Optional but helpful
External 5V Power Supply	1	For servo motors (2A min recommended)
Glove	1	To mount flex sensors on hand
Heat-shrink tubing / tape	Optional	For mounting sensors
Arduino USB Cable	1	To upload code and power Arduino

Stepwise process-

1.	 Attach each flex sensor onto a glove, one per finger, using tape or tubing.
2.	 Connect each flex sensor in a voltage divider with a 10kΩ resistor.
3.	 Connect each flex sensor’s output to Arduino analog pins (A0 to A4).
4.	 Connect each servo motor’s signal wire to digital pins (3 to 7).
5.   Power the servos with an external 5V source (do NOT power them from Arduino).
6.	 Make sure all grounds (Arduino, power supply, sensors, servos) are connected together.
7.	 Upload the Arduino code provided below.
8.	 Move your fingers while wearing the glove — the robotic arm will mimic your gestures.

Flex Sensor Wiring (per sensor):
• One end → 5V
• Other end → Arduino A0-A4
• Connect 10kΩ resistor from sensor output to GND (voltage divider)
Servo Motor Wiring:
• Signal wires → Digital pins 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
• VCC → External 5V Power Supply
• GND → Common GND with Arduino
Important Notes:
• Always use a separate power supply for servo motors.
• Ensure GND of Arduino and power supply are connected.
